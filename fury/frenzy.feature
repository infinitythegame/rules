# FURY: FRENZY
# The trooperâ€™s urge to kill is barely contained. Once they get
# a first taste of blood, they will become a whirlwind of death.
#
# REQUIREMENTS
# Frenzy activates only after the trooper causes an enemy to
# lose one point from their Wounds or STR Attribute.
#
# EFFECTS
# When they deploy, a trooper with Frenzy
# is Non Impetuous. However, if they cause
# an enemy to lose one point from their
# Wounds or STR Attribute, then they will
# start their next Active Turn as an Impetuous
# trooper and will remain Impetuous for the
# rest of the game.
#
# When a trooper with Frenzy becomes Impetuous, it loses the
# advantages provided by Special Skills like CH: Camouflage,
# CH: TO Camouflage (both are reduced to CH: Mimetism),
# Impersonation, Holoprojector (see Infinity. Human Sphere), etc.
