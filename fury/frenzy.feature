Feature:
  FURY: FRENZY
  The trooperâ€™s urge to kill is barely contained. Once they get
  a first taste of blood, they will become a whirlwind of death.

  REQUIREMENTS
  Frenzy activates only after the trooper causes an enemy to
  lose one point from their Wounds or STR Attribute.

  EFFECTS
  When they deploy, a trooper with Frenzy
  is Non Impetuous. However, if they cause
  an enemy to lose one point from their
  Wounds or STR Attribute, then they will
  start their next Active Turn as an Impetuous
  trooper and will remain Impetuous for the
  rest of the game.

  When a trooper with Frenzy becomes Impetuous, it loses the
  advantages provided by Special Skills like CH: Camouflage,
  CH: TO Camouflage (both are reduced to CH: Mimetism),
  Impersonation, Holoprojector (see Infinity. Human Sphere), etc.
