@fury@impetuousFeature:  FURY: IMPETUOUS  Impetuous troopers are always eager to engage in combat.  EFFECTS  Impetuous troopers have the same rules  as Extremely Impetuous troopers, with the  only exception that they are not obliged  to expend their Impetuous Order, and  can cancel it without paying the Regular  Order cost.  To do so, simply remove the Impetuous Order Marker from  the table, announcing that you decline to use it.  REMEMBER  Impetuous troopers cannot benefit from MODs for being in Partial  Cover.  Cancelling an Impetuous Order does not give the trooper the ability  to benefit from Partial Cover MODs, as the trooper is still Impetuous.
