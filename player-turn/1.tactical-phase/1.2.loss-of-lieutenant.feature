# Rules:
# Loss of Lieutenant check
# The Active Player checks whether they are in Loss of Lieutenant.
#
# Despite their training and their constant connection with
# Mission Control, losing a team leader to enemy fire or system
# failure can wreak havoc on the discipline of soldiers, creating
# a moment of confusion in which everyone is left to their
# own devices, without a coordinated tactical approach. This
# situation is usually temporary, and order reigns again once
# the next rung in the chain of command steps up or Mission
# Control chooses a new leader.
#
# ACTIVATION
# If, during the Tactical Phase of the Active Turn, the Active
# Player lacks a Lieutenant because they did not deploy or the
# previous Lieutenant is currently in a Null (Unconscious, Dead,
# Sepsitorizedâ€¦) or Isolated state, then a situation of Loss of
# Lieutenant is automatically declared.
#
# EFFECTS
# When an army enters a Loss of Lieutenant situation, all troops
# in its Army List become Irregular.
