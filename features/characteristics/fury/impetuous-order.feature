Feature: Impetuous Order
  IMPETUOUS ORDER

  REQUIREMENTS
  Troopers must expend their Impetuous Orders during the
  Impetuous Phase.

  Impetuous Orders allow only a number of fixed combinations
  of Common Skills, as indicated by the Impetuous Order Chart.
  During an Impetuous Order, you cannot declare Skills or
  combinations of Skills not in the Impetuous Order Table.

  As shown by the Chart, the order in which the Skills are
  declared is irrelevant (Move can be declared first or second).

  IMPETUOUS ORDER
  Legal combinations of Skills
  Airborne Deployment
  Move + Activate (Activate + Move)
  Move + Attack (Attack + Move)
  Move + Dodge (Dodge + Move)
  Move + Idle (Idle + Move)
  Move + Move
  Jump
  Climb

  The Common Skill Move is mandatory in all Impetuous
  Orders, where it works in a specific and limited way.

  When a trooper declares Move as part of an Impetuous
  Order, they always move the entirety of their corresponding
  MOV value.

  For example, if an Impetuous (or Extremely Impetuous)
  trooper declares Move once during an Impetuous Order,
  they moves the total amount of inches indicated by the first
  value of their MOV. If Move is declared a second time during
  the Impetuous Order, they also move the full number of
  inches indicated by the second value of their MOV.

  A trooper using an Impetuous Order can move a distance
  shorter than the maximum only if they reach base contact
  with an enemy, or if they enter an area of Special Terrain
  that impairs their Movement or forces them to declare Jump
  or Climb in order to keep moving.

  Impetuous Order: Direction of Movement

  When executing a Move as part of an Impetuous Order, the
  trooper must move towards the nearest enemy figure by the
  most direct route possible.

  The nearest enemy figure is the one that can be reached in the
  least number of Orders, even if that figure is not in LoF. Jump
  or Climb skills must be used if that would shorten the route.
  If there are no enemy figures on the table, the trooper treats
  the closest point in the enemy Deployment Zone as the closest
  enemy trooper and moves towards it as above. If the trooper is
  already in the enemy Deployment Zone, and there are no enemy
  figures on the table, then the Impetuous Order is cancelled.

  Markers and figures in a Null state (Unconscious, Sepsitorized…)
  do not count as enemies for the purposes of Impetuous movement.
  During an Impetuous Order a trooper can never move in a
  Prone state so they will automatically stand up at the beginning
  of the mandatory Move, or at the start of a Jump or Climb.

  As shown by the Impetuous Order Chart (see page 47), an
  Impetuous (or Extremely Impetuous) trooper can substitute
  the combination of the mandatory Common Skill Move +
  [allowed Skill] for the Entire Order Skills Climb or Jump if
  these are necessary to fulfill their obligation to advance towards
  the nearest enemy.
  In this case, as it would when using Move, the movement
  declared with Climb or Jump must be the entirety of the first
  value of the trooper’s MOV, and must be directed towards the
  nearest enemy figure, or towards the enemy Deployment Zone
  without retreating unless forced to by terrain.
  Impetuous (or Extremely Impetuous) troopers that have not
  deployed because of the Special Skill Airborne Deployment must
  use their Impetuous Orders to deploy during the Impetuous
  Phase of their Player Turn.

  Canceling an Impetuous Order
  During their Impetuous Phase, players can cancel one
  Impetuous Order of an Extremely Impetuous trooper by
  expending one Regular Order from that Order Pool. To do so,
  remove the Impetuous Order Marker from that trooper, who
  cannot use it for any other purpose.
  Canceling an Impetuous Order does not give the trooper the
  ability to benefit from Partial Cover MODs, as the trooper is
  still Impetuous.

  Impetuous Order and Deployment
  If the Impetuous Order is used to perform a deployment
  outside the Deployment Phase (By using a Special Skill such
  as Airborne Deployment, for example) the Impetuous (Or
  Extremely Impetuous) trooper will provide their Order to the
  owning player the moment they are placed on the game table, adding
  it to the Order Pool if they are Regular, or placing it next to the
  trooper if they are Irregular.
  REMEMBER
  The Impetuous Order cannot be used in a Retreat! situation.
