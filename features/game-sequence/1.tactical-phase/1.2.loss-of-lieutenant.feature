Feature: Loss of Lieutenant check
  The Active Player checks whether they are in Loss of Lieutenant.

  Despite their training and their constant connection with
  Mission Control, losing a team leader to enemy fire or system
  failure can wreak havoc on the discipline of soldiers, creating
  a moment of confusion in which everyone is left to their
  own devices, without a coordinated tactical approach. This
  situation is usually temporary, and order reigns again once
  the next rung in the chain of command steps up or Mission
  Control chooses a new leader.

  ACTIVATION
  If, during the Tactical Phase of the Active Turn, the Active
  Player lacks a Lieutenant because they did not deploy or the
  previous Lieutenant is currently in a Null (Unconscious, Dead,
  Sepsitorized…) or Isolated state, then a situation of Loss of
  Lieutenant is automatically declared.

  EFFECTS
  When an army enters a Loss of Lieutenant situation, all troops
  in its Army List become Irregular.

  CANCELLATION
  The player can appoint a new Lieutenant at no cost at the
  end of the Turn in which he entered the Loss of Lieutenant
  situation. The identity of this new Lieutenant is still considered
  Private Information.
