Feature: Add all of the Regular Orders to the Order Pool of each Combat Group
  Order count
  The Active Player counts how many Orders they have at their disposal
  for this Turn, by counting the number, type and state of
  their troops. They also applies the effects of Retreat! and/or Loss
  of Lieutenant (if necessary).
  Regular Orders (p.27)
  For each Regular troop deployed on the table that is not in a
  Null state (Unconscious, Dead, Sepsitorizedâ€¦), the Active Player
  adds one Regular Order Marker (REGULAR) to his Order Pool.
