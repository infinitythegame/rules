Rules as [Gherkin][Gherkin] feature files.

Gherkin is a tool for [Behaviour-Driven Development][BDD] (BDD) and is used to 
provide [Specification by Example][SBE}, a concept whereby you describe the 
expected behaviour of a system through a series of exemplary cases. 
Each case is then described as a scenario, and the steps and eventual 
expected result clearly defined. 

More details of writing Gherkin and a primer in BDD can be found at [http://inviqa.com/bdd-guide][inviqa-bdd-guide]

Common tools for testing applications via BDD include:

- [Cucumber][cucumber] (Ruby)
- [Behat][behat] (port of Cucumber to PHP)
- [CucumberJS][cucumber-js] (port of Cucumber to JavaScript)
